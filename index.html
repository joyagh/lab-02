      <h2>A Little Bit About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Justine Oyaghiro and I am from Nashville, TN (one of the few
        natives left!). I have worked in healthcare for about 8 years, but I
        also have extensive experience in customer service. I attended
        University for a couple years, but didn't graduate. However, I want to
        get a B.S in psychology because I love learning about how the mind
        works!
      </p>
      <p>
        Traveling is probably my favorite thing to do. Ive been to atleast 20
        states, and I've traveled to 5 different countries. I'm pursuing web
        development because I want a career that pays well, and has work-life
        balance. I want the freedom to travel whenever I want. My goal is to
        become a digital nomad for a few years!
